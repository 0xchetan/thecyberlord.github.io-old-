### Who TF is Chetan Badhe?

Just another guy on the internet. Founding member and writer at [Feynmand](https://feynmand.com) and [Founder of a Failed Startup](https://medium.com/@chetanbadhe/my-journey-to-the-failed-startup-86b482bde30a). Indian Scholar at MITGSW 2016. Currently, pursuing bachlore's degree in Computer Engineering at D. Y. School of Engineering, Pune.

I code with Python. Interested in blockchain, mostly Ethereum enviornment. I'm a voracious reader, poor philosopher and [amateur writer](/blog). 

(Sounds cool on internet, total mess in real life.)
