Socrates once  quoted...

>## “Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people.” 

So if you're one of the **strong** mind let's connect.

### We Can Talk About

1. Cryptocurrencies, Decentralization, Mostly Ethereum VM (Development Only)
2. Philosophy & Wisdom
3. Open Intenet (yeah, I'm fan of [@aaronsw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz))
4. Physics, Mathematics
5. Books
6. TV Series 

### Where?

Facebook, WhatsApp and other chatting platforms are great but I don't think we can have meaningful conversations over there.

Best way of connecting would be **Google Hangouts** or **Email** (Introverts prefer emails generally)

Or if you're the one who live on terminal, join me over IRC / '**csbadhe**'.
